# Capstone Project - AI Trading Platform

### What is the project?

To build a platform for creating, backtesting and paper trading new automated strategies on real-time, minute scale data with the help of AI models.

# Components in the project

## Data Feeder

- Used to source real-time minute scale data from over 5000 stocks in the stock market.

- Perform very fast, basic calculations on the raw data.

## Database

- We use a database to store the data from the data feeder.

- We also use it to perform more complex calculations (such as indicators) very quickly at a large scale for all stocks whose data has been sent from the data feeder.

## Strategies

###### This is the heart of the project

- Strategies read data from the database and can use multiple indicators, machine learning models, or a combination to generate orders according to the rules mentioned in the strategy.

- There may be multiple strategies created and deployed in this service.

## Backtester

- This service helps in building Strategies. It allows us test how a strategy would have performed over past data over previous weeks, months and years.

- It takes a parameterised strategy and data over the period of the back test as input. It generates orders over the previous data according to the strategy's rules and outputs a detailed report on the performance of the strategy.

## Paper Trader

- This is used to test strategies in real-time market scenarios after a strategy has performed well in back testing.

- It tracks and evaluates orders generated by multiple strategies in real-time market conditions and provides various performance metrics for both strategies and orders.

## UI

- This service is a website which provides a GUI for the user to interact with all the other services.

- It allows the user flexibility to create, back test, paper trade and deploy new strategies on real-time data from the stock market.

# To build this project

### Development environment

1. run these commands to initialize the project:

```

git clone "git@github.com:Varun487/CapstoneProject_AITradingPlatform.git"

cd CapstoneProject_AITradingPlatform

docker-compose -f devops/docker-compose.dev.yml up

```

2. To start the backend and frontend development servers + run all containers:

```

docker-compose -f devops/docker-compose.dev.yml up

```

3. To stop and destroy all containers:

```

docker-compose -f devops/docker-compose.dev.yml down

```

4. Run with fresh build:

```

docker-compose -f devops/docker-compose.dev.yml down

docker-compose -f devops/docker-compose.dev.yml up --build

```

5. To create a super user for the database

```

docker-compose -f devops/docker-compose.dev.yml run restapi python3 manage.py createsuperuser

```

6. To run all restapi tests
```

docker-compose -f devops/docker-compose.dev.yml run restapi python3 manage.py test

```

7. Command to Initialize the database
```

docker-compose -f devops/docker-compose.dev.yml run restapi python3 manage.py initialize

```
8. Command to run all paper trade services
```

docker-compose -f devops/docker-compose.dev.yml run restapi python3 manage.py papertrade

```

###### NOTE: To run in production, the commands are the same, but the file is `docker-compose.prod.yml`
